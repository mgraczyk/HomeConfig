# the following two calls make it so we can have a global environment, with
# global initializations of things like prompts, path, manpath and such,
# while allowing you to customize things you like. You don't have to
# worry about us changing your local things, because we just change
# the global files, and stay out of your home directory.

#
# source the global .login file, if it exists
#
# this gives you the Qualcomm standard initializations, calls initializations
# based on which groups you are a member of, then calls your subscribed package
# initializations. To see what is happening, just look at the files. If you
# have questions, call Hotline at x-1099.
